These are just highlights of what was changed during each release.  For a more
in-depth version of what was changed, please look at the ChangeLog.

1.0
---
- Added support for 24 bit color
- Created command line tool that uses DevIL library for loading/saving images
- Use autotools for build system

hqx-lite 
---
- changed lookuptable for RGB to YUV conversion so it uses three seperate tables
  This drastically reduces the memory usage (the table chanes from 64 Mb to 3 kb), and initializes witout notable delay
  The actual scaling is slightly slower, but that is fine if you only apply it to loaded sprites instead 
  of every frame of an emulator.
